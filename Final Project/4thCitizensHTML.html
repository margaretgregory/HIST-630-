            <h2>Remember Little Rock</h2>
            
            <p>The greatest encounter between the constitutional rights of the people and the states
                vs. the usurped powers by the Federal Government occurred at <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place003">Little Rock</a> "Remember <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place003">Little Rock</a>" is the battle cry for people who believe it is their sacred right to' educate their
                children in their own way without interference from politically motivated federal
                sources who know little of local conditions. Because of what happened
                in <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place003">Little Rock</a>, Americans everywhere were made aware of the vicious determination of the so-called
                "liberal minority groups" in their obsession to force their will upon those who differ.
                The entire nation owes a debt of gratitude to the patriotic citizens of <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place003">Little Rock</a>, who refused to bow to the
                tyranny of forced integration. </p> 
            
            <h2>NEITHER SUDDENLY NOR GRADUALLY</h2>
            
            <p>The danger of sudden integration may have passed, but there is great danger, now that
                the frontal attack by the mongrelizer s failed that the will resort to "infiltration"
                and "gradualism." </p>
            
            <p>Southern observers who have watched neighborhood integration in the North now realize
                that "Being a little bit integrated is like being a little bit pregnant." There is
                no such thing as being a little bit integrated. Our Northern friends are horrified
                to find that their original concession to "a little integration" has inevitably forced
                them to' give up their homes and flee to the suburbs. The flight continues, and where
                it will stop no one knows. </p>  
            
            <h2>MIGRATION</h2>
            
            <p>For economic and other reasons, brought about by selfish politicians and misinformed
                "do-gooders," the Negro" migration to the North has increased and will continue to
                increase. The end result of this migration will help our cause, but we feel for our
                Northern white citizens. Already in many Northern sections innocent white people are
                being forced to suffer a second "reconstruction" such as our ancestors suffered eighty-five
                years ago. This is tragic. History proves, however, that the masses of people have
                never reacted to logic and common sense, but only to chaos and bitter experience.
                The best cure for "integration and Negro domination" is "integration and Negro domination,"
                although it is a painful one that leaves many permanent scars. In many areas "the
                situation will have to get worse before it gets better."</p>
            
            
            <h2> RACIAL SEPARATION </h2>
            
            <p> The South respectfully submits that the best method by which the two races can occupy
                the same geographical area with a minimum of racial conflict is through the time honored
                and history proven expedient which is called "segregation." </p>
            
            
            <h2>ORGANIZATION</h2>
            
            <p> The only method by which racial separation can be continued is through local, state
                and natiQnal organization, in order that the many powerful organizations which seek
                mongrelization can be counteracted. Many organizations dedicated to racial separation
                have started in the North and West, and there will be many more in the years ahead.
                Many of these organizations are not called "Citizens' Councils," but "a rose by any
                other name would smell as sweet," and their purpose is basically the same as ours.</p>
            
            
            <h2>POLITICS </h2>
            
            <p>The Citizens' Council is not a political organization, but in our form of government
                it is natural that sentiment in favor of racial separation will express itself politically
                by one method or another. This is already evident in the South, and will be evident
                in Northern and Western areas' eventually. </p>
            
            
            <h2>OUR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE </h2>
            
            <p>Listed on page 1 are the members of our Executive Committee. Four Executive Committeemen
                are elected to serve from each one of our six Congressional Districts. This election
                is held at the annual district meeting of county chairmen in each district. These
                are the men who set the policy and direct our State Association. Your State Executive
                Committee meets the third Thursday in each month, in <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place004">Jackson, Mississippi</a>, at one of the hotels there. It is always a dutch luncheon meeting. This group provides
                the personal contact necessary so that your Association will be truly representative
                of the local Citizens' Councils in the state. We ask that you note the name of your
                Executive Committeeman, so that you can get in touch with him at any time. </p>
            
            <p>We have urged the board of directors of each local organization to hold a similar
                monthly meeting. The holding of these regular meetings provides a constant, competent
                body to deal with any local problems that may arise, and has led in every case to
                a strong local organization. </p>
            
            
            <h2>OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM </h2>
            
            <p>Your State Executive Committee has engaged an outstanding lady, <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person029">Mrs. Sara McCorkle</a>, to direct Women's activities in connection with the Citizens' Council movement throughout
                the state, and to direct the  for the youth of <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place002">Mississippi</a>. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person029">Mrs. McCorkle</a> has made many talks to various Civic organizations throughout the state and to many
                ladies' organizations. She assists the local Citizens' Councils in carrying on educational
                programs for the young people in the community, in giving the facts concerning race
                and the reasons for the South's policy of racial separation. She directs our annual
                essay contest among high school students. </p>
            
            
            <h2>THE CITIZENS' COUNCIL FORUM </h2>
            
            <p>We now have the Citizens' Council Forum television program in nine Southern states,
                on at least seventeen different stations, and we have the Citizens' Council Forum
                radio programs on more than one hundred radio stations throughout the South. The idea
                is to inform our people, here in the
                South, as to the true facts concerning "integration" and to present the South's case
                to the nation. As soon as possible, we intend to expand this program to cover the
                entire nation. <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person031">Bill Simmons</a>, as the producer of these programs, is doing a magnificent job. He maintains a complete
                staff at our <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place004">Jackson</a> office in the Plaza Building</p>
            
            
            <h2>OUR OWN NEWSPAPER </h2>
            
            <p>Since October, 1955, we have been publishing our own monthly newspaper, which acts
                as the official organ for the Citizens' Councils of America movement. We have never
                missed an issue, and we urge the local organizations to subscribe for each member,
                so that the local membership will have an idea about what is going on state wide and
                nationally. </p>
            
            <p>We have found that the most economical means of keeping our members informed and of
                penetrating the paper curtain which in the past has' kept the truth from the public
                is through this fine publication. All of us are proud of the fine job that <a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person031">Bill Simmons</a> has done as editor of our official organ. </p>
            
            <p>Local Councils that have subscribed to our newspaper for each of their members find
                that they are well informed and are kept interested in this movement. Our members
                in <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place002">Mississippi</a> are urged to mail their copies of the newspaper to friends and relatives in the North
                after they have read it each month. </p>
            
            <p>We certainly hope that next year each Council will subscribe to our newspaper for
                each of its members. The subscription price has been set at $1.00 per year for members
                in lots of 50 or more subscriptions, the lowest figure ossible, since no advertising
                is accepted. For single subscribers the subscription price is $2.00 per year. </p>
            
            <p>If preferred, you may send your subscription direct to The Citizens' Council, <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place004">1014 Plaza Building, Jackson, Miss.</a> </p>
            
            
            <h2>OUR STATE OFFICE </h2>
            
            <p>Our state office in <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place005">Greenwood</a>employs, in addition to the Executive Secretary and Director of Women's Activities,
                four full time employees to handle national correspondence, educational publications,
                and administrative organizational work. Our office receives as high as 300 letters
                per week from fortyeight states and many foreign countries. All inquiries are answered
                and orders for literature are filled promptly</p>
            
            <p>We carry on an active correspondence with Citizens' Councils and other organizations
                all over the United States. We exchange information and carryon liaison with all sincere
                patriotic groups and individuals who are dedicated to constitutional government. We
                have mailed over five million pamphlets to key individuals and organizations in every
                state in the union and in most foreign countries. These pamphlets, by prominent and
                respected authorities, present the case for the South, states' rights and racial integrity.
            </p>
            
            <p>Three years ago it was clearly evident that most of the national magazines were slanting
                news stories against the South. Lately, we have noticed a reluctant leakage of truth
                concerning the United States Supreme Court and the Negro race from even such rabid
                anti-South publications as Time and Life. </p>
            
            <p>Negro migration to the North and the determined presentation of facts by Southerners
                has helped to bring about this phenomenon. </p>
            
            
            <h2>THE CITIZENS' COUNCILS OF AMERICA</h2>
            
            <p>The Citizens' Councils of America was organized in <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place006">New Orleans</a> in , with individuals from eleven Southern States participating. It has held regular
                semi-annual meetings each year since that time</p>
            
            <p>We believe that this organization will continue to serve as an effective coordinating
                agency and information center for the various state groups. Our office in <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place005">Greenwood</a> is the national administrative headquarters. </p>
            
            <p><a href="./Standoff.xhtml#person027">ROBERT B. PATTERSON,</a> Executive Secretary </p> 
            
            
            <h2>WHAT YOU CAN DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL</h2>
            
            <p>1. Study all the facts which give concrete reasons why the
                South and the nation must maintain its racial integrity. You
                cannot do your part in educating your children, relatives, friends, neighbors and
                business associates unless you know
                the facts. Subscribe to publications which give the truth about
                integration. In order to counteract the propaganda campaign
                against us, we must carry on a continuous educational program and you can help. </p>
            
            <p>2. Join a worthwhile organization dedicated to constitutional government and racial
                integrity such as the Citizens' Council. Be a good member and remember that your dues
                and your efforts are the keys to victory. This is your fight. Organized aggression
                must be met with organized resistance. </p>
            
            <p>3. Enlist additional members for your local organization.
                Educate your fellow citizens so that we may all stand together. Contact friends in
                other counties and states and encourage them to organize. Remember, the mongrelizers
                are well organized and highly financed. </p>
            
            <p>4. Keep informed of all efforts to integrate the races. In
                this manner a mobilized public opinion may express itself from every direction against
                every attempt at integration. </p>
            
            <p>5. Write letters expressing your views to newspapers, and
                magazines, as well as to your local, state and national officials. Your letter combined
                with thousands of others will have
                a resounding effect. </p>
            
            <p>6. Vote for those seeking public office who actively and
                honestly resist the integration of the races. This also includes
                your school board and the governing body of your church. </p>
            
            <p>7. Be alert for all propaganda movements towards integration, whether in the theatre,
                television, radio, athletic events,
                schools, newspapers, magazines, books, or the church. These
                programs are cleverly planned to soften our people to the
                idea of mixing of the races. If you should cancel a subscription or withhold patronage,
                give your reason. </p>
            
            <p>8. Be sure you know what is being taught your children in
                School and Church.</p>
            
            <p>9. Stand firnlly in the right. Let everyone know that you
                stand for segregation of the races. </p>
            
            <p>10. There are scalawags among us today just as there were
                in reconstruction days-people who live among us and thrive
                upon us, but who are willing to sell us out to the mongrelizers.
                Integrationists who live among us are much more dangerous
                to our cause than those who live in <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place001">New York</a> or <a href="./StandoffHTML.xhtml#place007">Illinois</a>. </p>
